# DSA Cheat Sheets (Python Based Solutions)
Last updated: 09/13/2022

Recommended study method -> Grind 75 Problems sort by topics -> Anki Flashcards study a single topic -> practice Grind 75 questions of this topic -> if stuck on topic go to Common Data Structure and Algorithms Patterns / Templates files and spend time in the debugger stepping through common patterns to derive a a solution

DSA Udemy Course I took (Highly recommend & good community): [ZTM Master Coding Interview DSA](https://www.udemy.com/course/master-the-coding-interview-data-structures-algorithms/)
Youtubers for Leetcode solutions: Neetcode and HappyCoding

## Data Structures and Algorithms Flashcards:
The is an all inclusive 450+ flashcard set that covers common data structure and algorithms topics. I have shared 2 decks (both have the same cards). The first one is the traditional Anki study methods if you have extra time because it limits the amount of cards you can study. The second deck is all the cards without any restrictions good for cramming or specific topic studying prior to practicing leetcode.

## Common Data Structures and Algorithms Patterns & Templates
This is a unique list of DSA templates and common questions I have encountered while studying Leetcode / Grind 75. It is a great resource to practice the nuances of some of the problems to recognize the patterns. I would recommend running the python file to see how the questions answers appear in the terminal then you can go to the section you want to study. This document is really good for spending time in the debugger stepping through problems you are struggling with.

|Recursion / Backtracking (Subsets, Permutations and Combinations)|
|Sorting Algorithms|
|Binary Trees, Traversals and BST Recursive / Iterative Implementation|
|Graphs / Grids|
|Heaps and Priority Queues|


## Grind 75 Problems and Notes
Just a current updated excel document as I work through the grind 75 and my notes / thoughts. Feel free to download the file and work through these problems yourself and include your notes!
